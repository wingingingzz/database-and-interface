            Lying from you
            When I pretend 
            Everything is what I want it to be 
            I look exactly like what you had always wanted to see 
            When I pretend I can forget about the criminal 
            I am Stealing second after second just 'cause I know I can 
            But I can't pretend this is the way it will stay I'm just 
            [Trying to bend the truth] 
            I can't pretend I'm who you want me to be 
            So I'm Lying my way from you 
            [No, no turning back now] 
            I wanna be pushed aside 
            So let me go 
            [No, no turning back now] 
            Let me take back my life 
            I'd rather be all alone 
            [No turning back now] 
            Anywhere on my own 'Cause I can see 
            [No, no turning back now] 
            The very worst part of you
