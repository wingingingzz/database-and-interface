            Lying from you
            When I pretend 
            Everything is what I want it to be

            When I pretend I can forget about the criminal 
            I am Stealing second after second just 'cause I know I can 
            But I can't pretend this is the way it will stay I'm just 
            [Trying to bend the truth]

            So I'm Lying my way from you

            I wanna be pushed aside 
            So let me go 
            [No, no turning back now] 
            Let me take back my life
